Files needed to run LHC-MR

- 'variants.tsv.bgz' obtained from Neale's UKBB GWAS Imputed v3 to merge variant information to variant details of the summary statistics files 
https://broad-ukb-sumstats-us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com/round2/annotations/variants.tsv.bgz

- 'LDscores.txt' You can either use the classical LD scores https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/ or the ones we have calculated based on UK10K 
sequencing data https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uua6zIournPvcJAs-QVWs8pTUVLtZ5Ym/view?usp=sharing where the list of SNPs are optimised for UKB-based summary stats (e.g. by Neale)

- 'LD_GM2_2prm.txt' Local LD for each genotyped SNP, this file contains the pi and sigma values needed 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jN0N9VOnvrenBcb0cHxMzLJxi06D87jZ/view?usp=sharing

- ld and hm3 files needed to calculate the cross trait intercept obtained from LDSC run using the genomicSEM R package
LD files: `eur_w_ld_chr` folder found in https://utexas.box.com/s/vkd36n197m8klbaio3yzoxsee6sxo11v
hm3 files: you can get (and unzip) the comeplete HAPMAP3 SNPs here https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/w_hm3.snplist.bz2 (with MHC region)
Or get a 'cleaned' version without the MHC region here https://utexas.box.com/s/vkd36n197m8klbaio3yzoxsee6sxo11v
